## 🚀 Overview

Agent-Farm is an autonomous AI agent ecosystem designed to crawl GitHub, pinpoint real security vulnerabilities or code flaws, generate high-quality patches, validate fixes dynamically in isolated sandboxes, and submit pull requests or private disclosures. Operating with human-like precision, it implements advanced self-correcting DEV-QA loops and maintainer vibe analysis to ensure every contribution is high-value, precise, and completely regression-free.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 🧠 Omniscient Context Engine
Upgraded codebase intelligence using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered by ChromaDB. It recursively discovers internal documentation (`.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`), semantically chunks docs by headers, and indexes them to seed local knowledge. Concurrently, it builds AST-based call graphs to inject precise module dependency links ("imports", "calls", "dependents") directly into the prompt context.

### 🛡️ Zero-Garbage PR Gatekeepers
Zero tolerance for typo-fixes, formatting tweaks, or documentation-only PRs (README/doc contributions are strictly banned). Implements a two-layer filter system:
* **Gate 1: EXPERT APPRAISAL:** Renders strict verdicts on findings to filter out false positives and theoretical edge cases.
* **Gate 2: REAL-WORLD VALUE CHECK:** Vetoes patches targeting dead or deprecated code blocks to avoid sending low-effort spam to maintainers.

### 🧪 Dynamic Bug Verification (PoC Execution)
Before writing a fix, the agent generates a self-contained Proof-of-Concept (PoC) script to dynamically trigger the vulnerability inside a locked-down container sandbox. If the PoC fails to trigger the bug, the finding is immediately classified as a False Positive and dropped.

### 🔍 Blast Radius & Regression Auditing
Validates generated patches in isolated Docker sandboxes through a double-pass check:
* **Pass 1 (Efficacy):** Applies the patch and re-runs the PoC. The vulnerability must be completely resolved.
* **Pass 2 (Regression):** Executes the project's native test suite to ensure the patch does not break any existing functionality. Also verifies that changes do not break downstream dependent modules.

## 🏗️ System Architecture (High-Level)

The system revolves around a central orchestrator (`FarmAgentPipeline`) that coordinates a suite of agents:
1. **Discovery & Exploration:** Uses GitHub APIs to find suitable repositories and parses ASTs to map dependencies.
2. **Analysis:** Deep-scans codebases using Bloodhound Red Team logic for security, code quality, and UX flaws.
3. **Generation:** Employs LLMs (via OpenRouter, such as deepseek, qwen, and gemini) to draft targeted patches and PoCs.
4. **Validation:** Executes PoCs and test suites in a secure, isolated Docker sandbox.
5. **Submission:** Orchestrates forks, branch creation, commit staging, and PR submission.
6. **Maintenance:** PR Patrol monitors open PRs, responds to comments, and attempts to auto-heal CI failures.

## 🛠️ Getting Started (1-Click Docker Quick-Start)

Agent-Farm provides a robust, pre-configured Docker setup that mounts the Docker socket from the host to spawn sibling containers for isolated PoC and test execution.

### Prerequisites
* **Docker** (>= 7.1) Desktop installed and running.
* **Python** (>= 3.11).
* **Git** installed on the host machine.
* A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope.
* An OpenRouter API Key configured with credits.

### 1-Click Launch

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hieuit095/Agent-Farm.git
   cd Agent-Farm
   ```

2. **Run the Quick-Start Script:**
   * **Windows:** Double-click `start.bat` or run:
     ```cmd
     start.bat
     ```
   * **Unix (Linux/macOS):**
     ```bash
     chmod +x start.sh
     ./start.sh
     ```
   * *Note: The script will automatically pull the latest codebase, initialize your `.env` configuration file from `.env.example` if missing, build the Docker image, and launch the daemon in the background.*

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Open the newly created `.env` file and configure your API tokens (at minimum):
   ```env
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_pat_here
   MINIMAX_API_KEY=your_minimax_api_key_here
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
   ```

4. **Attach to the Agent CLI:**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it agent-farm farm_agent superhuman
   ```
